Summary
JWT token allows role manipulation without proper server validation.

Affected Endpoint
GET /api/dashboard

Vulnerability Type
Broken Access Control / Authentication Flaw

Severity

Description
JWT claims such as `role` and `userId` are trusted by the backend. Modifying these claims grants unauthorized access.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Login as a normal user.
2. Capture JWT token in Burp.
3. Decode JWT and modify `role` to admin.
4. Replay request in Repeater and observe access.

Impact
- Privilege escalation
- Unauthorized access to restricted resources

Remediation
- Validate JWT signatures and claims server-side
- Do not trust client-side data for authorization
