Username Enumeration via Login Functionality

Summary
The application leaks user existence through different authentication error
responses, allowing an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.

Target & Scope
- Platform: PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- Feature Tested: Login
- Access Level: Unauthenticated

Vulnerability Description
During login attempts, the application responds differently when a valid
username is supplied versus an invalid one. This enables username enumeration.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Intercept login request using Burp Suite.
2. Send login request with an invalid username.
3. Observe error message.
4. Send login request with a valid username and incorrect password.
5. Compare responses.

Proof of Concept
- Invalid username → `Invalid username or password`
- Valid username → `Incorrect password`

Impact
- Enables targeted brute-force attacks
- Increases account takeover risk

OWASP Mapping
- OWASP Top 10: A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures

Remediation
- Use generic error messages
- Apply rate limiting
- Monitor failed login attempts

Conclusion
Username enumeration weakens authentication security and should be remediated
to prevent further attacks.
